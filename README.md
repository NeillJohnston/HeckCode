# HeckCode
The programming language of the future Kappa.

HeckCode is a stupidly simple language I concocted after messing around with Brainfuck and wanting to try it myself.
Featuring:
+ _Boolean memory._ Each memory cell is either true or false, 1 or 0. Is this elegant? Probably not.
+ _Infinite memory tape._ Traverse up and down the tape to let your wildest dreams come true. Also we all know that infinite != infinite in this sense, don't freak out.
+ _8 operators._ That's all. The interpreter reads [ <>-+!&., ] (excluding brackets) and nothing else.
